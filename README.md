# Configuration Files

Repository to host some files for Troubleshooting and configuration files.

* **`Troubleshooting.md`**

  Some problems I found during executing scripts or looking for information.
  
* **`ReleaseZIP.py`**

  Make a ZIP file for releases, taking the files on a folder and adding them into the ZIP. It can exclude files and directories.
